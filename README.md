# higher-order-parametric-equalizers

Post Mortem

Orfanidis paper was elegant but unsolvable as dsp code

Implementing the orfanidis approach yielded parametric equalizers with notches in the peak, making them unusable

There was no way to fix this

RBJ proved to be fruitful as a way to implement the orfanidis equalizers on a working prototype
